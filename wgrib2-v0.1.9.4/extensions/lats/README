LATS4D
------

LATS4D (LATS for Dummies) is a minimum fuss gs script for writing
NetCDF, HDF-SDS or GRIB files from GrADS using the PCMDI LATS
interface. This script can serve as a general purpose file conversion
and subsetting utility. Any GrADS readable file (GrADS IEEE, GSFC
Phoenix, GRIB, NetCDF or HDF-SDS) can be subset and converted to GRIB,
NetCDF, HDF-SDS or binary using a single command line. By using one of
the regridding functions available to GrADS the output file can also
be converted to a different horizontal grid resolution.

When invoked without arguments from within GrADS this script will
create a COARDS compliant NetCDF or file named .grads.lats.nc,
with all the contents of the default file (all variables, levels,
times). The file name and several other attributes can be customized
at the command line, see the OPTIONS section in the manual page.

LATS4D is included in the OpenGrADS Bundle 2.0.a7.oga.3 and later, with
no additional installation neccesary. For manual installation
instructions in other versions of GrADS see file INSTALL.
