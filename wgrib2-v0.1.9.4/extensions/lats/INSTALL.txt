LATS4D Installation Notes
-------------------------

LATS4D is included in the OpenGrADS Bundle 2.0.a7.oga.3 and later,
with no additional installation neccesary. Follow these instructions
with other versions of GrADS see file INSTALL.

The installation is simple: simply place lats4d.gs along with your
other GrADS scripts (under /usr/local/lib/grads by default or on any
directory pointed to by the environment variable GASCRP, or even in
your local directory). The shell script lats4d.sh is a wrapper for
using LATS4D from the shell command line and should be place anywhere
in your path.
