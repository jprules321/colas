                    OpenGrADS User Contributed Extensions


The OpenGrADS User Defined Extensions (UDXTs) are a collection of
dynamically linker user defined commends (UDCs) and User Defined
Functions (UDFs) that complements the Grid Analysis and Display System
(GrADS). For building from sources see file BUILD.

REQUIREMENTS

Either GrADS v2.0.a5.oga.5 or later, installed


BUNDLE INSTALLATION

If you are using an OpenGrADS Bundle installation, the extensions are
pre-configured and require no extra installation. Start grads and type

ga-> q udx

for a list of extensions and enjoy.


CLASSIC INSTALLATION

First install GrADS. The GrADS executables are typically placed in the
directory /usr/local/bin. The libraries contained in this tar file are
typically placed in the directory /usr/local/bin/gex.  If you do not
have write permission for your /usr/local/bin directory, you can put
them in the ~/bin/gex subdirectory of your home directory or any other
directory of your choice. Henceforth, we will refer to the GrADS
installation directory as $GABIN, and assume that you install the
dynamic extensions in subdirectory gex/.

Whatever location you choose to install the UDXTs you must set the
environment variable GA2UDXT (for GrADS v2.0) or GA1UDXT (for the
legacy GrADS v1.10 series) to point to the location of your User
Defined Extension Table. To use the one in this distribution set

   export GAUDXT=$GABIN/gex/udxt    (sh, ksh, bash)
   setenv GAUDXT $GABIN/gex/udxt    (csh, tcsh)

You may want to familiarize yourself with the contents of the file
"$GABIN/gex/udx" and comment out any function that may cause any
conflict to you.

In addition, you need to let your operating system know where to
find these shared objects (dynamic libraries). Typically

- Linux, most Unices:

 export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$GABIN/gex:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH    (sh, ksh, bash)     
 setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH $GABIN/gex:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH    (csh, tcsh)

- IRIX64 Note:

 You man want to set the environment variable LD_LIBRARYN32_PATH for
 New 32-bit ABI and LD_LIBRARY64_PATH for 64-bit programs, in addition 
 the good old LD_LIBRARY_PATH. If this still does not work, enter the
 full pathnames in your "udxt" file. 

- Mac OS X

 export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$GABIN/gex:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH  (sh, ksh, bash)
 setenv DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH $GABIN/gex:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH  (csh, tcsh)


VERIFYING INSTALLATION

Start GrADS and enter

ga-> query udc
ga-> query udf

To see a list of all your user defined commands and functions. You may
want to try 

ga-> hello

which should print "Hello, World" to your screen.
