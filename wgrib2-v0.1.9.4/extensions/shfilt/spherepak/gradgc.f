c     subroutine gradgc(nlat,nlon,isym,nt,v,w,idvw,jdvw,a,b,mdab,ndab,
c    +                  wvhsgc,lvhsgc,work,lwork,ierror)
c
c     given the scalar spherical harmonic coefficients a and b, precomputed
c     by subroutine shagc for a scalar field sf, subroutine gradgc computes
c     an irrotational vector field (v,w) such that
c
c           gradient(sf) = (v,w).
c
c     v is the colatitudinal and w is the east longitudinal component
c     of the gradient.  i.e.,
c
c            v(i,j) = d(sf(i,j))/dtheta
c
c     and
c
c            w(i,j) = 1/sint*d(sf(i,j))/dlambda
c
c     at the gaussian colatitude point theta(i) (see nlat as input
c     parameter) and longitude lambda(j) = (j-1)*2*pi/nlon where
c     where sint = sin(theta(i)).  required associated legendre polynomials
c     are recomputed rather than stored as they are in subroutine gradgs. this
c     saves storage (compare lsav with lsav in gradgs) but increases
c     computational requirements.
c
c
c     input parameters
c
c     nlat   the number of points in the gaussian colatitude grid on the
c            full sphere. these lie in the interval (0,pi) and are computed
c            in radians in theta(1) <...< theta(nlat) by subroutine gaqd.
c            if nlat is odd the equator will be included as the grid point
c            theta((nlat+1)/2).  if nlat is even the equator will be
c            excluded as a grid point and will lie half way between
c            theta(nlat/2) and theta(nlat/2+1). nlat must be at least 3.
c            note: on the half sphere, the number of grid points in the
c            colatitudinal direction is nlat/2 if nlat is even or
c            (nlat+1)/2 if nlat is odd.
c
c     nlon   the number of distinct londitude points.  nlon determines
c            the grid increment in longitude as 2*pi/nlon. for example
c            nlon = 72 for a five degree grid. nlon must be greater than
c            3.  the efficiency of the computation is improved when nlon
c            is a product of small prime numbers.
c
c
c     isym   this has the same value as the isym that was input to
c            subroutine shagc to compute the arrays a and b from the
c            scalar field sf.  isym determines whether (v,w) are
c            computed on the full or half sphere as follows:
c
c      = 0
c
c           sf is not symmetric about the equator. in this case
c           the vector field (v,w) is computed on the entire sphere.
c           i.e., in the arrays  v(i,j),w(i,j) for i=1,...,nlat and
c           j=1,...,nlon.
c
c      = 1
c
c           sf is antisymmetric about the equator. in this case w is
c           antisymmetric and v is symmetric about the equator. w
c           and v are computed on the northern hemisphere only.  i.e.,
c           if nlat is odd they are computed for i=1,...,(nlat+1)/2
c           and j=1,...,nlon.  if nlat is even they are computed for
c           i=1,...,nlat/2 and j=1,...,nlon.
c
c      = 2
c
c           sf is symmetric about the equator. in this case w is
c           symmetric and v is antisymmetric about the equator. w
c           and v are computed on the northern hemisphere only.  i.e.,
c           if nlat is odd they are computed for i=1,...,(nlat+1)/2
c           and j=1,...,nlon.  if nlat is even they are computed for
c           i=1,...,nlat/2 and j=1,...,nlon.
c
c
c     nt     nt is the number of scalar and vector fields.  some
c            computational efficiency is obtained for multiple fields.
c            the arrays a,b,v, and w can be three dimensional corresponding
c            to an indexed multiple array sf.  in this case, multiple
c            vector synthesis will be performed to compute each vector
c            field.  the third index for a,b,v, and w is the synthesis
c            index which assumes the values k = 1,...,nt.  for a single
c            synthesis set nt = 1.  the description of the remaining
c            parameters is simplified by assuming that nt=1 or that a,b,v,
c            and w are two dimensional arrays.
c
c     idvw   the first dimension of the arrays v,w as it appears in
c            the program that calls gradgc. if isym = 0 then idvw
c            must be at least nlat.  if isym = 1 or 2 and nlat is
c            even then idvw must be at least nlat/2. if isym = 1 or 2
c            and nlat is odd then idvw must be at least (nlat+1)/2.
c
c     jdvw   the second dimension of the arrays v,w as it appears in
c            the program that calls gradgc. jdvw must be at least nlon.
c
c     a,b    two or three dimensional arrays (see input parameter nt)
c            that contain scalar spherical harmonic coefficients
c            of the scalar field array sf as computed by subroutine shagc.
c     ***    a,b must be computed by shagc prior to calling gradgc.
c
c     mdab   the first dimension of the arrays a and b as it appears in
c            the program that calls gradgc (and shagc). mdab must be at
c            least min0(nlat,(nlon+2)/2) if nlon is even or at least
c            min0(nlat,(nlon+1)/2) if nlon is odd.
c
c     ndab   the second dimension of the arrays a and b as it appears in
c            the program that calls gradgc (and shagc). ndab must be at
c            least nlat.
c
c
c     wvhsgc an array which must be initialized by subroutine vhsgci.
c            once initialized,
c            wvhsgc can be used repeatedly by gradgc as long as nlon
c            and nlat remain unchanged.  wvhsgc must not be altered
c            between calls of gradgc.
c
c
c     lvhsgc the dimension of the array wvhsgc as it appears in the
c            program that calls gradgc. Let
c
c               l1 = min0(nlat,nlon/2) if nlon is even or
c               l1 = min0(nlat,(nlon+1)/2) if nlon is odd
c
c            and
c
c               l2 = nlat/2                  if nlat is even or
c               l2 = (nlat+1)/2              if nlat is odd
c
c            lvhsgc must be at least
c
c               4*nlat*l2+3*max0(l1-2,0)*(nlat+nlat-l1-1)+nlon+15
c
c
c     work   a work array that does not have to be saved.
c
c     lwork  the dimension of the array work as it appears in the
c            program that calls gradgc. define
c
c               l1 = min0(nlat,nlon/2) if nlon is even or
c               l1 = min0(nlat,(nlon+1)/2) if nlon is odd
c
c            and
c
c               l2 = nlat/2                  if nlat is even or
c               l2 = (nlat+1)/2              if nlat is odd
c
c            if isym = 0 then lwork must be at least
c
c                nlat*(2*nt*nlon+max0(6*l2,nlon)) + nlat*(2*l1*nt+1)
c
c            if isym = 1 or 2 then lwork must be at least
